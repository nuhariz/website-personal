	 Bismillah Assalamualaikum. Before i go further i would to say thank you to everyone who read this entry. May this entry help you to stay positive and keep follow the rules that have been stated by the government to make sure that we can beat this virus together. Im sorry if there a word that maybe hurt you. So here we go..   

<H1> MY EXPERIENCE DURING MCO</H1>

<P> First of all, did you know what is MCO? </P>

<p> MCO refer to 2020 Malaysia Movement Control Order (malay : Perintah Kawalan Berkurung Malaysia 2020) that refers to a cordon sanitaire implemented  as a preventive measure of the federal government of Malaysia towards the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on March 18, 2020, thus a "movement control" was implemented throughout the country. The order was commonly referred to in some local and international media as the "Malaysia partial lockdown" or "Malaysia lockdown" </p>

<p> So basically, when the Prime Minister announced that Im was still at the campus, because Im was planning to go back in the evening, but then Im couldnt make it. </p>

<p> Here my experience during MCO at the college with my friends. At first, Im felt frustrated because Im cant go back home, but Im kept talking to myself that everything happened for a reason. So, there must be a reason why Im cant go back home to be with my family during MCO.</p>

<p> After 3 days being so restless at the college, Im got a called from one of the staff of UiTM asking what Im doing at the college, and then he asked me either Im want to help him and his team to make a face shield for the frontlines without wasting a time, Im agreed to give a help to make face shield. So, from that day, starting in the morning until evening, Im spent my time by doing face shield with them. </p>

<p>By doing that, Im found that it was something that must be one the reason why Im stuck in the college because Im always wanted to do some corporate social responsibilities (CSR) since Im was in secondary. So, Im took this opportunity wisely to make myself satisfied with what am Im doing. </p> 

<p> After two weeks, we managed to make almost 2200 pieces of face shield to distribute to the frontlines at Hospital and Klinik Kesihatan area Machang and Kuala Krai.

<UL> We managed to send this face shield to : 
	<LI> Hospital Kuala Krai </LI>
	<LI> Hospital Machang </LI>
	<LI> Klinik Kesihatan Labok </LI> </UL>

<p>I feel so blessed that Im get the chance to help our frontline by giving this face shield to them. I will put some picture below for you to see what kind of face shield that we did. </p>
